# SpaceWarp

Currently, a bad game that barely works.

To create an executable using Pyinstaller, run this command in the command line:
```shell
pyinstaller SpaceWarp.spec
```

## How to play

left/right to move
space/up to jump
up/down to navigate menu
enter to select something in the menu
r to restart

press a button completely to activate it. it opens the door(s) with the same colour for 5 seconds
collect a key to permanently open all doors of that colour
make it to the spaceship or whatever that is to win
